    "The first step in our LSTM is to decide what information we’re going to throw away from the cell state. This decision is made by a sigmoid layer called the “forget gate layer.” It looks at $h_{t-1}$ and $x_t$, and outputs a number between $0$ and $1$ for each number in the cell state $C_{t-1}$.

In such a problem, the cell state might include the gender of the present subject, so that the correct pronouns can be used. When we see a new subject, we want to forget the gender of the old subject.\n",

    "The next step is to decide what new information we’re going to store in the cell state. This has two parts. First, a sigmoid layer called the “input gate layer” decides which values we’ll update. Next, a tanh layer creates a vector of new candidate values, $\\tilde{C}_t$, that could be added to the state. In the next step, we’ll combine these two to create an update to the state.\n",

    "Finally, we need to decide what we’re going to output. This output will be based on our cell state, but will be a filtered version. First, we run a sigmoid layer which decides what parts of the cell state we’re going to output. Then, we put the cell state through $\\tanh$ to push the values to be between $-1$ and $1$ and multiply it by the output of the sigmoid gate, so that we only output the parts we decided to.\n",

For example, it might output whether the subject is singular or plural, so that we know what form a verb should be conjugated into if that’s what follows next.\n",

    "What I’ve described so far is a pretty normal LSTM. But not all LSTMs are the same as the above. In fact, it seems like almost every paper involving LSTMs uses a slightly different version. The differences are minor, but it’s worth mentioning some of them.\n",

    "Another variation is to use coupled forget and input gates. Instead of separately deciding what to forget and what we should add new information to, we make those decisions together. We only forget when we’re going to input something in its place. We only input new values to the state when we forget something older.\n",

    "A slightly more dramatic variation on the LSTM is the Gated Recurrent Unit, or GRU. It combines the forget and input gates into a single “update gate.” It also merges the cell state and hidden state, and makes some other changes. The resulting model is simpler than standard LSTM models, and has been growing increasingly popular.\n",
