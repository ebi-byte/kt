    "To solve the Vanishing-Exploding gradients problem often encountered during the operation of a basic Recurrent Neural Network, many variations were developed. One of the most famous variations is the Long Short Term Memory Network(LSTM). One of the lesser known but equally effective variations is the Gated Recurrent Unit Network(GRU).\n",

    "Unlike LSTM, it consists of only two gates and does not maintain an Internal Cell State. The information which is stored in the Internal Cell State in an LSTM recurrent unit is incorporated into the hidden state of the Gated Recurrent Unit. This collective information is passed onto the next Gated Recurrent Unit. The different gates of a GRU are as described below:-\n",
    "\n",
    "**Update Gate(z):** It determines how much of the past knowledge needs to be passed along into the future. It is analogous to the Output Gate in an LSTM recurrent unit.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "**Current Memory Gate():** It is often overlooked during a typical discussion on Gated Recurrent Unit Network. It is incorporated into the Reset Gate just like the Input Modulation Gate is a sub-part of the Input Gate and is used to introduce some non-linearity into the input and to also make the input Zero-mean. Another reason to make it a sub-part of the Reset gate is to reduce the effect that previous information has on the current information that is being passed into the future.\n",

Why do we make use of GRU when we clearly have more control on the network through the LSTM model (as we have three gates)? In which scenario GRU is preferred over LSTM?**"
