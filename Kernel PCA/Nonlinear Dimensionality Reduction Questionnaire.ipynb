    "##### What makes the Gaussian kernel so magical for PCA?\n",
    "Given a positive definite kernel $k$, there exists its corresponding space of functions $\\mathcal{H}$. Properties of functions are determined by the kernel. It turns out that if $k$ is a Gaussian kernel, the functions in $\\mathcal{H}$ are very smooth. So, a learned function (e.g, a regression function, principal components in kernel PCA) is very smooth. Usually smoothness assumption is sensible for most datasets we want to tackle. This explains why a Gaussian kernel is magical."
