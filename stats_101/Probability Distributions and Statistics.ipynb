A probability distribution is specified in terms of an underlying sample space, which is the set of all possible outcomes of the random phenomenon being observed. The sample space may be the set of real numbers or a set of vectors, or it may be a list of non-numerical values; for example, the sample space of a coin flip would be {heads, tails}. \n",

    "Probability distributions are generally divided into two classes - Discrete and Continuous. A discrete probability distribution (applicable to the scenarios where the set of possible outcomes is discrete) can be encoded by a discrete list of the probabilities of the outcomes, known as a probability mass function. Well-known discrete probability distributions used in statistical modeling include the Poisson, the Bernoulli, the binomialand the geometric distribution. On the other hand, a continuous probability distribution (applicable to the scenarios where the set of possible outcomes can take on values in a continuous range) is typically described by probability density functions.

It follows the syntax NORMDIST(X,mean,standard dev.,cumulative) where X is normally distributed and cumulative is a switch.

The Poisson distribution can also be used for the number of events in other specified intervals such as distance, area or volume. For instance, an individual keeping track of the amount of mail they receive each day may notice that they receive an average number of 4 letters per day. If receiving any particular piece of mail does not affect the arrival times of future pieces of mail, i.e., if pieces of mail from a wide range of sources arrive independently of one another, then a reasonable assumption is that the number of pieces of mail received in a day obeys a Poisson distribution.\n",

Chi-Square goodness of fit test determines how well theoretical distribution (such as normal, binomial, or Poisson) fits the empirical distribution. In Chi-Square goodness of fit test, sample data is divided into intervals. Then the numbers of points that fall into the interval are compared, with the expected numbers of points in each interval.\n",

    "The likelihood of type I error, is equal to the level of significance, that the researcher sets for his test. Here the level of significance refers to the chances of making type I error. Often, the significance level is set to 0.05 (5%), implying that it is acceptable to have a 5% probability of incorrectly rejecting the null hypothesis. The likelihood of making type II error is analogous to the power of the test. The power of the test is the probability that the test will find a statistically significant difference between men and women, as a function of the size of the true difference between those two populations. As the sample size increases, the power of test also increases, that results in the reduction in risk of making type II error. Power = 1 - risk of Type II error. \n",
